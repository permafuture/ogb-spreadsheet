LIST OF EVENTS


# BOOKS

We sell books, and things that bookstores might sell.

Our specialty is brand-new books by local authors. We also have a wide variety of used books: fiction, poetry, Southwest writers, and more.

We take books for trade or donation, and buy books directly from local authors. Bring used books in any time we're open.

Our trade policy is $1 for paperbacks, $2 for tall paperbacks, and $5 for select hardbacks. Or, donate your books and we'll put your credit toward our 20% Teachers Discount!

We can order books for you! We buy books from an international network of independent bookstores. Contact Max for more information.

We buy local!

If you're a local author, we want to carry your books! Contact Steve, or come to the store during buying hours, 10am to 12 noon.

If you're a local artisan, bring us things that bookstores might sell! We want to carry your gift cards, calendars, stickers, and other crafts. Talk to Kelly, or drop a sample by the store any day.

We're the Brewer family: Steve, Kelly, Max, Seth and Jalila. We love books. We've been writing, reading, designing and editing for over a hundred years.

We think that books are more important than ever. In a busy, distracted world, a real book is an oasis. Books change the way we think. They stretch our attention spans, challenge our opinions, transport us to other worlds. People who read books are more curious, more rational, and more kind.

We're building a place for books and the people who love them. A place for community, right here in our beloved Nob Hill. A place away from the distractions of home and work. A gateway to other lands, a secret portal to the world of the book people.

We're on a journey. Come with us.
