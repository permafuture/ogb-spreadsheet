# PLAN FOR WEBSITE WITH EVENTS AND SUCH

Okay. The website needs to create business for us, but for our customers it needs to answer their questions and give them a certain "vibe". The organization of the site should be to answer their questions in order of our priorities.

Our main conversion is to get people in the store. That's how we make money, so we need to make it effortless to get in the store. Once they're in, the books will do their magic and we'll make money.

The second goal is to get books in. We need local authors (especially ones that will sell) to bring us their books and to come check regularly if they're sold out. We also need people to bring us trade books and donations.

The third function of the website is to get the word out: add people to the mailing list, get followers on social, and get shares on our posts. This also includes telling Our Story and creating a cult following, but that's harder to quantify.

The lowest priority is to reduce FAQs (Facile Annoying Queries), to create a better environment for us worker/owners.

### 2. GET BOOKS IN STORE

* Will you carry the book I wrote?
 * Probably! We love buying local. Bring your books in between 10 and 12 AM, or [email Steve for more info]().

* Will you carry the book by DISTANT RELATIVE that I've never read but I've heard it's really good?
 * Probably not! We are willing to stretch our definition of "local" in certain cases, though. Try to persuade us.

* Will you carry THING THAT BOOKSTORES MIGHT SELL that I made?
 * Likely! We really like locally-made gift cards, journals, stickers and other papery goods, and we're open to carrying other merch. Bring us a sample to look at and we'll let you know! Or [contact Kelly](organicbooksellers+kelly@gmail.com) with more questions.

* Can I bring books as a donation?
 * Sure! We can usually take boxed donations, sight unseen. We'll sift through and rehome the ones we can't sell. Due to the work involved with this, we can't give trade credit for donations.

 * Thanks for the donation, then. See you next time! /*
