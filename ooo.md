# ORDER OF OPERATIONS

*/ ## Get all the content in place
* semantic organization along points of need
* blocks of copy?
* organize the FAQS into proper narrative?
* video from Gus as hero? maybe after loading picture?
* compositional pages. use it right /*

*/ ## Make the logic happen right
* calendar only showing the days we have events?
 * logic is in groupEventsByMonth I think. and in calendar.js
* single event on homepage is next event
* do own logic for this. events only. not calendar.
  * can I just iterate through all the items, compare them to todays date, and only print the ones after that? is that reasonable? /*

## Make the UX easy to traverse
* navigation should be simple and re-usable. tabs are not doing the right effect for sub-pages, how does that work?
 - layers? bottom vs top? maybe vertical words?
* nav and footer as components in layout
* custom heroes for each page but with standard structure
  * convert to data eventually


## Style the whole thing according to our standards
* make a proper palette
* use theme to instantiate palette
* right pix/vids and textures for theme
* typography and grid alignment

## Test for all different sizes and fix bugs
