# ORDER OF OPERATIONS

## Get all the content in place
* semantic organization along points of need
* blocks of copy?
* organize the FAQS into proper narrative?
* video from Gus as hero? maybe after loading picture?
* compositional pages. use it right

## Make the logic happen right
* calendar only showing the days we have events?
 * logic is in groupEventsByMonth I think. and in calendar.js
* single event on homepage is next event

## Make the UX easy to traverse
* navigation should be simple and re-usable. tabs are not doing the right effect for sub-pages, how does that work?

## Style the whole thing according to our standards
* make a proper palette
* use theme to instantiate palette

## Test for all different sizes and fix bugs
