FINISHED STYLING MAIN PAGES

still got to:

[x] fix navigation
[x] setup front page styling
[x] setup front page event box
[x] different illustrations for each page
[x] fix modal on events page
[x] edit images
[x] (made colors match on bg)
[x] fixed hyphenation

[] (later) make ink bleed to page texture
[] easter eggs?
[] footer with madeBy
[] style mailchimp transform
[] polish Video
[] polish contact images
[] spreadsheet Credits
[] style Credits
[] add icons where fun



* Can I make the credits list go to a spreadsheet query? It would make it easier to keep track of, and add to. I could also make it so the list is alphabetical automatically!
